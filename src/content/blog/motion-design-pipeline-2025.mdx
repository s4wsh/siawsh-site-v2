## Principles first

Constraints force good defaults. A shared library of timing curves and componentized builds travels across tools.

## Tooling that fades away

From boards to renders, scripts connect layers without ceremony. Less clicking, more composing.

## Reuse motion the right way

Systematize the pieces that should repeat, and keep room for edges that deserve a fresh move.
