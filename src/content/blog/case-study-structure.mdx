## The arc that works

Every project is different, but the most digestible case studies share a rhythm: context, constraints, path, and outcomes. Keep each section short.

## Sections that readers scan

Start with a oneâ€‘paragraph brief and the hard constraints. Then describe the process in two to three steps, and close with measurable results.

## What to collect while working

Capture source files, intermediate frames, and rationales as you go. It makes the final story honest and fast to assemble.
